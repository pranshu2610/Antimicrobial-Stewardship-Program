# Antimicrobial-Stewardship-Program
Antimicrobial Stewardship Program - Idea pitching done for Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2020. Implementation of Data Scrappers and Tools to store and analyse antibiotic data.
# What is ASP?
Antimicrobial stewardship. Antimicrobial stewardship is a coordinated program that promotes the appropriate use of antimicrobials (including antibiotics), improves patient outcomes, reduces microbial resistance, and decreases the spread of infections caused by multidrug-resistant organisms.
# How this works?
Our Program works on two steps:
  1. Data collecting and segregation : this involves collection of data about all antibiotic from a Pharmacy Invoice and Medication Bills.
  2. GUI support : a gui app can provide an interactive support to common people to know what sort of medication they are about to consume. This gui helps to distinguish a particular drug by its brand name as well as its generic name too. However it also provide the class of antibiotic which can be used by data models to classify individual antibiotics in group. Hence an effecient way of applying learning models for research part
